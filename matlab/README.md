# MATLAB Scripts for VertigoIMU

This directory contains sets of m-functions and m-scripts to deal with
processing and analysis of data in MATLAB from VertigoIMU.

To allow many people to work on this at the same time, please **do not commit
directly to the master branch**. Instead, create a branch, work on your
feature/script/plots, and then open a pull request from your branch into
master.

Any questions, email [Email me](jon+vertigo@jonsowman.com).
